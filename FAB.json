    "question": "What is the outlook for net interest margins?",
    "answer": "Our outlook for net interest margins (NIM) reflects recent shifts in the interest rate environment and deposit mix:\n\n- Group NIM for Q3'25 was 1.76%, down 4bps quarter-on-quarter and 13bps from the Q1'25 peak of 1.97%. This decline is primarily due to lower benchmark rates, including a 25bps Fed rate cut in September 2025, and a shift in deposit mix<sup>1</sup>.\n- For the first nine months of 2025 (9M'25), NIM averaged 1.84%, which is 9bps lower year-on-year, reflecting the impact of lower benchmark rates<sup>1</sup>.\n- In H1'25, NIM was 1.88%, 6bps lower year-on-year, with Q2'25 at 1.80% (down 17bps quarter-on-quarter), mainly due to lower IIS recoveries and higher central bank placements<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>.\n- Management estimates that a -25bps parallel movement in interest rates would have a P&L impact of approximately AED 200 million if no offsetting action is taken<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>.\n\nWhile NIMs have moderated from their 2024 highs, our strong volume growth and disciplined pricing continue to support resilient net interest income. The outlook remains sensitive to further changes in benchmark rates and deposit mix, with additional rate cuts anticipated into 2026<sup>1</sup>.\n\nReferences:\n\n<sup>1</sup> [Q3 2025 Earnings Presentation p. 11](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/3038#page=11)  \n<sup>2</sup> [Q2 2025 Earnings Presentation p. 11](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/1707#page=11)  \n<sup>3</sup> [Investor Presentation Q2 2025 p. 25](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/2711#page=25)",

By the end of 2024, we had already achieved 53% of this goal<sup>1</sup>.\n- Our ESG strategy is built on three pillars:\n  - Transitioning to a low-carbon future (net zero for our own operations by 2030, and financed emissions by 2050)\n  - Transforming our governance model (including a dedicated Board Risk & ESG Committee)\n  - Capitalising on our social responsibility (with targets for diversity, inclusion, and Emiratisation)<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>.\n- In 2024, we introduced a comprehensive Group Climate Risk Policy and Group Climate Risk Framework, including climate risk scoring and stress testing<sup>1</sup>.\n\n**Governance & Oversight**\n- ESG principles are fully integrated into our governance framework, with dedicated committees such as the Board Risk and ESG Committee (BRESGC), Group ESG Committee (G-ESGC), and ESG and Sustainable Finance Committee (ESG-SFC) overseeing strategy, risk, and performance<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>.\n- In 2024, these committees reviewed progress against ESG targets, approved updates to frameworks and policies, and ensured ESG topics are regularly addressed at the highest levels<sup>5</sup>.\n\n**Sustainable Finance & Reporting**\n- Our Sustainable Finance Framework guides the classification and monitoring of sustainable and transition finance. All ESG deals are tagged in our systems, with monthly reporting and annual public disclosures in our Sustainable Finance and ESG Reports<sup>6</sup>.\n- We have a dedicated ESG and Sustainable Finance Committee to assess and classify all transactions for ESG compliance before credit approval<sup>7</sup>.\n\n**Capacity Building & Culture**\n- In 2024, we delivered over 27,000 hours of ESG training to employees (averaging four hours per employee), and 99% of staff received anti-corruption training<sup>8</sup>.\n- ESG awareness and capacity-building are embedded across all levels, including senior leadership, to drive cultural transformation<sup>9</sup>.\n\n**Recognition & Transparency**\n- FAB is included in major ESG indices such as MSCI Emerging Markets ESG Leaders and FTSE4Good Emerging Market, and maintains strong ESG ratings (Sustainalytics: 16.9, MSCI: AA, Refinitiv: 79 as of September 2025)<sup>10</sup>.\n- We publish annual ESG, Sustainable Finance, and Equator Principles reports, aligned with international standards like GRI, ICMA, and the Net Zero Banking Alliance<sup>11</sup>.\n\nReferences:\n\n<sup>1</sup> [Annual Report 2024 p. 56](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/436#page=56)  \n<sup>2</sup> [Second Party Opinion by ISS on FAB Sustainable Finance p. 67](https://www.bankfab.com/-/media/fab-uds/about-fab/sustainability/reports-policy-frameworks/documents/spo-fab-011223.pdf#page=67)  \n<sup>3</sup> [Sustainable Finance Framework p. 3](https://www.bankfab.com/-/media/fab-uds/about-fab/sustainability/reports-policy-frameworks/documents/fab-sustainable-finance-framework-report.pdf#page=3)  \n<sup>4</sup> [Corporate Governance Report 2024 p. 26](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/1207#page=26)  \n<sup>5</sup> [ESG report 2024 p. 45](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/1739#page=45)  \n<sup>6</sup> [Sustainable Finance Framework p. 7](https://www.bankfab.com/-/media/fab-uds/about-fab/sustainability/reports-policy-frameworks/documents/fab-sustainable-finance-framework-report.pdf#page=7)  \n<sup>7</sup> [sustainability - Sustainable Finance](https://www.bankfab.com/en-ae/about-fab/sustainability/sustainable-finance)  \n<sup>8</sup> [ESG report 2024 p. 43](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/1739#page=43)  \n<sup>9</sup> [ESG report 2024 p. 48](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/1739#page=48)  \n<sup>10</sup> [Euroland Company Fact sheet](https://www.bankfab.com/en-ae/about-fab/investor-relations)  \n<sup>11</sup> [FAB 2024 USD 750 Million Tier 2 (T2) Capital Securities due 2035 p. 92](https://www.bankfab.com/-/media/fab-uds/about-fab/investor-relations/debt-investor-information/prospectuses/other-prospectuses/project-kp--prospectus-final-with-edisclaimer.pdf#page=92)",

    "answer": "Our C-suite has addressed the impact of a weakening dollar on several occasions. Here are the key comments:\n\n- We do not engage in material FX position-taking on the US dollar. Given the AED is pegged to the USD, our FX principal risk remains within appetite, and there is no real expansion of FX risk across the board. As a result, the weakening dollar does not have a direct correlation to our revenue stream<sup>1</sup>.\n- Regarding deposit gathering in international branches, management does not see a link between the weakening dollar and our ability to attract deposits. Deposit growth is driven more by commercial flows, business activity, and individuals building cash balances. Our AA- rating also attracts deposits as a flight to safety during volatile times<sup>2</sup>.\n\nReferences:\n\n<sup>1</sup> [Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript p. 11](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/741#page=11)  \n<sup>2</sup> [Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript p. 19](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/741#page=19)",

NIM is expected to be in the 1.80%–1.85% range for the remainder of the year.\n- We remain well positioned to sustain momentum into the final quarter, with continued strategic execution in lending, deposits, and client acquisitions, supported by deeper engagement across investment banking, wholesale, and personal banking.\n\nReferences:\n\n<sup>1</sup> [Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript p. 2](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/3120#page=2)  \n<sup>2</sup> [Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript p. 12](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/3120#page=12)",

    "question": "What is the outlook for net interest margins?",
    "answer": "Our outlook for net interest margins (NIM) reflects recent market dynamics and interest rate movements:\n\n- Group NIM for Q3'25 was 1.76%, down 4bps quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to a shift in deposit mix. For the first nine months of 2025, NIM averaged 1.84%, which is 9bps lower year-on-year, largely reflecting lower benchmark rates, including the 25bps Fed rate cut in September 2025<sup>1</sup>.\n- The NIM trend has shown a decline in recent quarters: Q1'25 at 1.97%, Q2'25 at 1.80%, and Q3'25 at 1.76%. This marks a reversal from the earlier upward trajectory seen in 2024 and early 2025<sup>1</sup>.\n- Management estimates that a -25bps parallel movement in interest rates would have a negative P&L impact of approximately AED 200mn, if no offsetting action is taken<sup>1</sup>.\n- The outlook for the remainder of 2025 and into 2026 anticipates further rate cuts, which could continue to exert downward pressure on NIMs. The bank expects 2 additional rate cuts in Q4'25 and 2-3 more in FY'26<sup>2</sup>.\n\nIn summary, while NIMs have remained resilient due to strong volume growth and disciplined pricing, the outlook is for continued pressure on margins given the anticipated lower interest rate environment.\n\nReferences:\n\n<sup>1</sup> [Q3 2025 Earnings Presentation p. 11](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/3038#page=11)  \n<sup>2</sup> [Q3/9M’25 Earnings Presentation p. 4, 6](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/3038#page=4)",

    "question": "What is your approach to risk management",
    "answer": "Our approach to risk management is comprehensive and embedded across all levels of the organization, ensuring we deliver risk-adjusted returns while safeguarding our stakeholders and maintaining regulatory compliance. Here’s how we manage risk at FAB:\n\n- **Risk Governance & Structure**\n  - The Board of Directors sets the risk management tone and is responsible for the overall direction, supervision, and control of risk. Oversight is delegated to specialist committees, notably the Board Risk & ESG Committee (BRESGC), which oversees risk strategy, frameworks, appetite, and culture<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>.\n  - We operate a robust \"three lines of defence\" model:\n    - **First line:** Business units and support functions identify, own, and manage risks in their daily operations, ensuring activities are within our risk appetite.\n    - **Second line:** Independent risk management and compliance functions provide oversight, develop policies, monitor exposures, and challenge the first line.\n    - **Third line:** Internal Audit provides independent assurance to the Board and senior management on the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>.\n\n- **Risk Management Framework**\n  - Our framework covers all material risks, including credit, market, liquidity, operational, capital, legal, compliance, ESG, model, and shari’ah compliance risks.\n  - We establish a formal risk appetite, reviewed regularly by executive management and the Board, reflecting our business strategy and market environment.\n  - Risk monitoring and control are based on defined limits, scenario analysis, credit risk mitigation (collateral, guarantees, netting), and risk transfer mechanisms such as hedging for interest and currency risks.\n  - All major transactions are assessed and authorized by appropriate management before execution, with ongoing monitoring of risk mitigation effectiveness<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>.\n\n- **Operational Risk Management**\n  - We implement an operational risk management cycle aligned with Basel standards, covering identification, assessment, mitigation, control, and monitoring.\n  - Operational risks are identified by business owners using risk matrices, covering all products, services, processes, and channels, including outsourced activities.\n  - The Group Operational & Fraud Risk Committee (GOFRC) provides oversight on operational and fraud risks, ensuring alignment with business strategies and risk priorities<sup>4</sup>.\n\n- **Risk Measurement & Reporting**\n  - We use advanced risk measurement systems, including Value at Risk (VaR) models for market risk, and regularly perform stress testing and scenario analyses.\n  - Risk reports are tailored and submitted periodically to the Board, risk committees, and senior management, ensuring informed decision-making and sound risk management<sup>3</sup>.\n\n- **Integration & Culture**\n  - Our risk appetite is embedded into decision-making and business strategy, fostering a strong risk culture and operational discipline at all levels.\n  - Regular training and awareness initiatives are conducted for staff and customers to maintain a robust risk culture<sup>1</sup>.\n\n- **Compliance & Best Practices**\n  - The risk management framework and strategies are dynamically updated in line with regulatory requirements and market best practices.\n  - We comply with the Basel Standardised approach for risk-weighted assets and capital requirements, and maintain optimal capital adequacy as per our risk appetite<sup>3</sup>.\n\nReferences:\n\n<sup>1</sup> [Annual Report 2024 p. 159-161](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/436#page=159)  \n<sup>2</sup> [FAB 2024 USD 750 Million Tier 2 (T2) Capital Securities due 2035 p. 99](https://www.bankfab.com/-/media/fab-uds/about-fab/investor-relations/debt-investor-information/prospectuses/other-prospectuses/project-kp--prospectus-final-with-edisclaimer.pdf#page=99)  \n<sup>3</sup> [Q4 Quarterly Pillar3 Disclosures 2024 p. 19, 95-97](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/546#page=19)  \n<sup>4</sup> [Q4 Quarterly Pillar3 Disclosures 2024 p. 95-97](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/546#page=95)  \n<sup>5</sup> [4th Quarter Report 2024 p. 85, 87, 107, 113](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/1200#page=85)",

    "question": "What is Fab's carbon footprint",
    "answer": "FAB’s carbon footprint is managed and disclosed through a comprehensive approach covering both operational and financed emissions:\n\n- We have set 2019 as our baseline year for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting, with a third-party materiality assessment conducted to determine our baseline emissions. The UAE and Egypt offices account for over 97% of our total emissions. Our Group GHG inventory is regularly expanded and enhanced for optimal disclosure, and we are working to include more Scope 3 categories, such as employee commuting<sup>1</sup>.\n- FAB is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, both in our own operations and across our financed portfolio. We have applied emission reduction net zero targets to 8 high-emitting sectors within our loan portfolio, which represent approximately 90% of financed emissions. We have also ceased new financing for coal-fired mining and coal-based power generation<sup>2</sup>.\n- Since January 2022, we calculate financed emissions in line with the PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials) methodology and disclose GHG emissions of our financial portfolio accordingly. Our targets focus on reducing carbon-related financed emissions in Oil & Gas, Power Generation, and Aviation, which together account for 80% of our total financed emissions<sup>3</sup>.\n- FAB’s sustainability and net zero reports, including detailed methodologies and progress against our targets, are available on our website<sup>4</sup>.\n\nReferences:\n\n<sup>1</sup> [ESG report 2024 p. 77](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/1739#page=77)  \n<sup>2</sup> [June 2024 Barclays ESG Corporate p. 9](https://www.bankfab.com/-/media/fab-uds/about-fab/investor-relations/reports-and-presentations/presentations/pdfs/2024/june-2024-barclays-esg-corporate-days.pdf#page=9)  \n<sup>3</sup> [Second Party Opinion by ISS on FAB Sustainable Finance p. 62](https://www.bankfab.com/-/media/fab-uds/about-fab/sustainability/reports-policy-frameworks/documents/spo-fab-011223.pdf#page=62)  \n<sup>4</sup> [FAB 2024 USD 750 Million Tier 2 (T2) Capital Securities due 2035 p. 92](https://www.bankfab.com/-/media/fab-uds/about-fab/investor-relations/debt-investor-information/prospectuses/other-prospectuses/project-kp--prospectus-final-with-edisclaimer.pdf#page=92)",

    "question": "is FAb share price overvalued right now?",
    "answer": "Based on the latest available data, FAB shares are not considered overvalued at this time. Here’s why:\n\n- **Current Share Price vs. Target Price:** As of October 30, 2025, FAB shares are trading at AED 17.76. According to the latest investor presentation, FAB is trading at an 8% discount to its target price, based on the average Bloomberg consensus, with the share price at USD 4.1 and the target price at USD 4.5 as of May 2025<sup>1</sup>.\n- **Valuation Multiples:** FAB’s price to tangible book value (P/TBV) multiple is 1.73x, which is about 15% below both its historical average (1.99x) and the current MENA banks average (2.04x). This suggests the stock is trading at a discount relative to its own history and to regional peers<sup>2</sup>.\n- **Analyst Recommendations:** The majority of analysts currently rate FAB as either Buy, Overweight, or Hold, with only one Reduce rating and no Sell ratings. The average rating is 2.31 (where lower is more positive), indicating a generally favorable view among analysts<sup>3</sup>.\n- **Performance and Fundamentals:** FAB delivered a record net profit of AED 16.02 billion for the first nine months of 2025, up 24% year-on-year, with a strong Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) of 20.0%. The bank’s fundamentals remain robust, with solid capital and liquidity ratios<sup>3</sup>.\n\n**Summary:**  \nFAB shares are currently trading below both their target price and historical valuation multiples, and analyst sentiment is generally positive. There is no indication from the latest data that the shares are overvalued.\n\nReferences:  \n<sup>1</sup> [Debt Investor Presentation Q1 2025 p. 53](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/946#page=53)  \n<sup>2</sup> [Investor Presentation Q1 2025 p. 8](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/945#page=8)  \n<sup>3</sup> [Euroland Company Fact sheet](https://www.bankfab.com/en-ae/about-fab/investor-relations)",

    "question": "What is the outlook for your non-funded income line? Can we expect it to be 60% repeatable as communicated previously?",
    "answer": "Our outlook for non-funded income remains robust and is a key pillar of our revenue diversification strategy. Here’s what you need to know:\n\n- Non-funded income contributed 46% of total Group revenue for the first nine months of 2025, up from 38% in the prior year period. This reflects our ongoing strategic focus on scaling up fee and trading businesses across all divisions<sup>1</sup>.\n- Non-interest income surged 37% year-on-year to AED 12.70 billion for 9M’25, with strong growth across all components—fees and commissions, FX, and investment income<sup>2</sup>.\n- Management continues to estimate that around 60% of our non-funded income is “sticky and repeatable.” This view has been reiterated consistently over recent quarters, and we remain confident in this level of repeatability going forward<sup>3</sup>.\n- The recurring nature of this income is supported by consistent fee generation, robust client flows, and the structural relevance of our global markets and wealth management businesses<sup>3</sup>.\n- While there can be some quarter-to-quarter volatility—especially in trading and “other income” lines—our underlying franchise strength and cross-sell capabilities support a high degree of income stability<sup>3</sup>.\n\nReferences:\n\n<sup>1</sup> [Q3 2025 Earnings Presentation p. 10](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/3038#page=10)  \n<sup>2</sup> [Management Discussion & Analysis p. 2-6](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/3039#page=2)  \n<sup>3</sup> [Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript p. 8](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/1829#page=8)",

    "question": "Your NPLs declined in Q3 to 2.6%, what drove this? What is your outlook on this metric?",
    "answer": "Our non-performing loans (NPL) ratio declined to 2.6% as of Q3 2025, down from 3.8% a year earlier—a significant improvement of 122 basis points. This drop was primarily driven by subdued NPL formation and an accelerated pace of write-offs, supported by a strong macro-economic backdrop. Impairment charges for the first nine months of 2025 fell 18% year-on-year to AED 2.33bn, reflecting both lower new NPL inflows and active portfolio management. Provision coverage also strengthened to 106%, up from 95% in the prior year, further enhancing our balance sheet resilience<sup>1</sup>.\n\nLooking ahead, our outlook on asset quality remains positive. The macro environment in the UAE continues to be supportive, and we are maintaining disciplined risk management. While we do not provide explicit forward guidance on the NPL ratio, the current trend of low NPL formation and strong coverage levels positions us well to sustain robust asset quality metrics through the remainder of the year<sup>1</sup>.\n\nReferences:\n\n<sup>1</sup> [Q3 2025 Earnings Presentation p. 8](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/3038#page=8)",

    "question": "What are the main drivers behind FAB’s growth strategy?",
    "answer": "The main drivers behind FAB’s growth strategy are:\n\n- **Diversified Revenue Streams & Client-Centric Solutions:** Our growth is propelled by broad-based revenue generation across all business segments, with a strong focus on client-centric solutions. In the first nine months of 2025, we delivered a record net profit of AED 16.02 billion (up 24% yoy), driven by robust performance in Investment Banking & Markets (revenue up 17% yoy), Wholesale Banking (revenue up 12% yoy), and Personal, Business, Wealth & Privileged Client Banking (revenue up 12% yoy). Our international franchise contributed 17% of Group revenue, with loans and deposits rising 23% and 18% year-to-date, respectively<sup>1</sup>.\n\n- **Geographic Expansion & Global Connectivity:** We continue to expand our footprint across more than 20 global markets, reinforcing our role as a regional anchor for cross-border capital, trade, and investment flows. Recent growth corridors include Asia, MENA, Europe, and the UK. New representative offices in Nigeria and Turkey, and a branch in GIFT City, India, further strengthen our international presence<sup>1</sup>.\n\n- **Digital Transformation & AI Adoption:** Accelerating digital innovation is core to our strategy. We are scaling AI-driven solutions across operations, with 18 live AI agents deployed in areas such as Trade Operations and Customer Service, reducing turnaround times by up to 50%. Over 96% of service requests are now processed digitally, and we have launched an AI Innovation Hub in partnership with Microsoft to further embed advanced AI capabilities across the Group<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>.\n\n- **Sustainability Leadership:** FAB is committed to leading in sustainable finance, having facilitated AED 327 billion in sustainable and transition financing to date—65% of our AED 500 billion 2030 target. This aligns with our strategy to embed ESG principles across our business and governance frameworks<sup>1</sup>.\n\n- **Product & Service Innovation:** We continue to introduce innovative products and exemplary customer service, particularly in Private Banking and Wealth Management. Our international booking centres now account for 40% of consolidated Private Banking revenues, with significant growth in the UK, France, Switzerland, and Saudi Arabia<sup>3</sup>.\n\n- **Strategic Partnerships & Industry Collaboration:** We leverage strategic partnerships in areas such as supply chain finance, cross-border payments, and fintech ecosystems. Our collaboration with Microsoft and other global AI leaders accelerates our digital transformation and positions us as a market innovator<sup>2</sup>.\n\n- **Operational Excellence & Risk Management:** We maintain strong capital and liquidity positions (CET1 ratio of 13.7%, LCR of 158%), disciplined cost management (cost-to-income ratio at 22.0%), and a high-quality risk profile, supporting sustainable growth and resilience<sup>1</sup>.\n\nReferences:  \n<sup>1</sup> [Management Discussion & Analysis Q3 2025 p. 4](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/3039#page=4)  \n<sup>2</sup> [FAB shareholders approve highest-ever cash dividend of AED 8.3 billion at Annual General Meeting](https://www.bankfab.com/en-ae/about-fab/group/in-the-media/highest-ever-cash-dividend-agm)  \n<sup>3</sup> [Annual Report 2024 p. 45](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/436#page=45)",

    "question": "How has FAB’s performance evolved over the past few years?",
    "answer": "FAB’s performance over the past few years has shown strong and consistent growth, marked by record profitability, expanding business volumes, and robust returns:\n\n**2025 (Year-to-date through Q3):**\n- Net profit for the first nine months reached AED 16.02 billion, up 24% year-on-year.\n- Group revenue (operating income) rose 16% to AED 27.65 billion.\n- Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) stood at 20.0%, well above the medium-term target of >16%.\n- Total assets grew to AED 1.38 trillion, up 14% year-to-date.\n- Non-interest income surged 37% year-on-year, now contributing 46% of Group revenue.\n- Cost-to-income ratio improved to 22.0%, and net impairment charges dropped 18% year-on-year.\n- All business divisions delivered record revenue, with international operations contributing 17% of Group revenue and international loans and deposits up 23% and 18% year-to-date, respectively<sup>1</sup>.\n\n**2024 (Full Year):**\n- Net profit after tax rose 4% to AED 17.1 billion, despite absorbing the impact of the newly introduced UAE corporate tax.\n- Profit before tax reached AED 19.9 billion, up 13% year-on-year.\n- Operating income grew 15% to AED 31.6 billion, driven by strong business volumes and improved margins.\n- Net interest income reached AED 19.6 billion, up 8% year-on-year, with net interest margin (NIM) improving to 1.93%.\n- RoTE for 2024 was 16.8%, in line with guidance<sup>2</sup>.\n\n**2023 and Earlier:**\n- 2023 and 2024 were both characterized by double-digit revenue and profit growth, supported by operational efficiencies, a strong balance sheet, and a diversified business model.\n- The bank’s total asset base crossed the AED 1.2 trillion threshold in 2024, reflecting ongoing expansion and business momentum<sup>3</sup>.\n\n**Strategic and Operational Highlights:**\n- FAB has maintained the region’s strongest credit ratings (AA- or equivalent) and a robust capital and liquidity position.\n- The bank continues to invest in AI, digital transformation, and sustainability, including the issuance of the UAE’s first-ever Social Bonds and the region’s first blockchain-based digital bond.\n- International expansion has accelerated, with new branches and increased presence in Europe, Turkey, Nigeria, and India.\n- FAB’s business mix is increasingly diversified, with non-funds income and international operations contributing more significantly to overall results<sup>1</sup>.\n\n**Summary:**  \nOver the past few years, FAB has delivered record financial results, sustained double-digit growth in profits and revenues, and strengthened its position as the UAE’s global bank. The Group remains on track to meet or exceed its financial guidance, driven by disciplined execution, innovation, and a focus on sustainable, diversified growth.\n\nReferences:  \n<sup>1</sup> [Euroland Company Fact sheet](https://www.bankfab.com/en-ae/about-fab/investor-relations)  \n<sup>2</sup> [Annual Report 2024 p. 14](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/436#page=14)  \n<sup>3</sup> [1st Quarter Analyses Report 2024 p. 3](https://www.bankfab.com/-/media/fab-uds/about-fab/investor-relations/reports-and-presentations/quarterly-and-annual-reports/2024/fab-mda-q1-2024-english.pdf#page=3)",

    "question": "What is the outlook for net interest margins?",
    "answer": "Our outlook for net interest margins (NIM) reflects the recent trend of resilience but also recognizes some pressure from lower benchmark rates and shifts in deposit mix:\n\n- Group NIM for Q3'25 was 1.76%, down 4bps quarter-on-quarter and 13bps from the Q1'25 peak of 1.97%. The decline primarily reflects a shift in deposit mix and the impact of lower benchmark rates, including a 25bps Fed rate cut in September 2025<sup>1</sup>.\n- For the first nine months of 2025, Group NIM averaged 1.84%, which is 9bps lower year-on-year, mainly due to the lower rate environment<sup>1</sup>.\n- Management estimates that a -25bps parallel movement in interest rates would have a P&L impact of approximately AED 200 million if no offsetting action is taken<sup>1</sup>.\n- The Q2'25 NIM was 1.80%, 17bps lower quarter-on-quarter, reflecting lower IIS recoveries and higher central bank placements<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>.\n- The overall message is that while margins remain resilient, we expect some continued pressure in the near term as rate cuts filter through and deposit mix evolves. However, our disciplined pricing and strong business momentum help to mitigate some of this impact<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>.\n\nReferences:  \n<sup>1</sup> [Q3 2025 Earnings Presentation p. 11](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/3038#page=11)  \n<sup>2</sup> [Q2 2025 Earnings Presentation p. 11](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/1707#page=11)  \n<sup>3</sup> [Investor Presentation Q2 2025 p. 25](https://wise-storage.euroland.com/api/pdf/download/2711#page=25)",
